Description: Power calculations are a critical component of any research study to determine theminimum sample size necessary to detect differences between multiple groups. Researchersoften work with data taking the form of proportions that can be modeled with a betadistribution. Here we present anRpackage, BetaPASS, and analogous SAS macro, thatperform power and sample size calculations using a beta distribution with comparativenonparametric output. This package allows flexibility with multiple options for link func-tions to fit the data.
